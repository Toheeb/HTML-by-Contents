This 14-page web book is both a learning resource for designers, and a design specification for makers. You can read it at [toheeb.com/en/html-by-contents/](https://www.toheeb.com/en/html-by-contents/)

Unlike [MDN,](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML) [web.dev,](https://web.dev/learn/html) or [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), this resource organized HTML by contents over elements to aid writing semantic markup. In addition, it introduced 10 Content Models to complete the partial hierarchy of the [7 Content Models in the HTML Standard.](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#kinds-of-content)

Special thanks to Jeremy Keith who unexpectedly passed a [vote of confidence](https://adactio.com/links/19466) when this was a rough idea in 2022.

PS: I wish 200 persons will each [buy me a $5 coffee at ko-fi.](https://ko-fi.com/olaabiyi) This gift will have 5 compounding effects. It'll help me:

1. afford a solar system as a reliable power source

2. use that capability to help more designers resolve their HTML issues

3. use that experience to enrich the book so designers can help themselves

4. use that completeness to help makers and I build a better HTML Authoring Tool

5. use the tool to achieve my goal of [reforming the web](https://www.toheeb.com/en/portfolio/)
