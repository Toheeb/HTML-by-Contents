<h1 id="content-block">The 14 Content Blocks of HTML</h1>

A Content Block builds a [Content Window](/en/html-content-windows/) with Topics and Paragraphs. Each Topic or Paragraph use a set of Text, [Objects,](/en/html-content-objects/) and [Forms,](/en/html-content-forms/) [Breaks,](/en/html-content-breaks/) and [Connotations.](/en/html-content-connotations/)


A Topic Block is either a Heading Block or a Title Block. Heading Blocks contribute to the document outline while Title Blocks don't. As a result, both Title Blocks and Paragraph Blocks follow an Heading Block in a [Content Part,](/en/html-content-parts/) optionally through a [Content Mix.](/en/html-content-mixes/)


<nav class="list-to-grid">
  <h2>Outline</h2>
    
  The 14 Content Blocks in 4 groups are as follows:

  - <span id="block-headings">Heading Blocks</span>

    - [L1 Heading](#heading-l1)

    - [L2 Heading](#heading-l2)

    - [L3 Heading](#heading-l3)

    - [L4 Heading](#heading-l4)

    - [L5 Heading](#heading-l5)

    - [L6 Heading](#heading-l6)


  - <span id="block-headings-secondary">Secondary Headings</span>

    - [Kicker Block](#block-kicker)

    - [Subheading Block](#block-subheading)


  - <span id="block-titles">Title Blocks</span>

    - [Details Title](#title-details)

    - [Fieldset Title](#title-fieldset)

    - [Column Title](#title-column)

    - [Association Title](#title-description)
    
  - <span id="block-paragraphs">Paragraph Blocks</span>

    - [Plain Paragraph](#paragraph-plain)

    - [Preformatted Paragraph](#paragraph-preformatted)

  Besides, two or more Plain Paragraphs can leverage a [Paragraph Separator](#paragraph-separator)

  Meanwhile, each Content Block can leverage the following utilities within or outside the block:

  - [Bitmap Version](#version-bitmap)

  - [Noscript Version](#version-noscript)
