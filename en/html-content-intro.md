# Introduction

In my quest to reform the web, I needed to make an HTML Authoring Tool. I, an author cum maker, need to think like a creator.

Both creators and authors think in contents. Our thought decides to create – for example – a heading, a subheading, and some plain paragraphs.

Authors, however, need to rethink in HTML. To create a subheading, authors need a `p` element that must follow one of `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, or `h6` element in a `hgroup` element.

Yet, learning resources explain HTML by elements-to-use before content-they-creates; whereas, Authors think by contents-to-create before elements-to-use ... a conflict of expectations.

Moreso, by HTML design, one element may be multi-purpose and still insufficient to markup one content. 

Both challenges would make a learner struggle to find information and understand relationships of elements that markup a content. This could result to incorrect use of elements, loss in semantics, incompatibility with user agents, and, finally, bad experience for users at unexpected times.

HTML by Contents pioneers a total content-first HTML learning resource. It explains HTML by contents-to-create to align with an author's mind.

It introduces 10 Content Models to improve the partial hierarchy of the 7 Content Models recorded in the HTML Living Standard. Partial hierarchy because `div` and `p` belong to the Flow Content Model but `p`allows phrasing contents while `div`allows `flow` contents.

The cover page provides you with a [practical approach](/en/html-by-contents#steps) and a [conceptual approach](/en/html-by-contents#toc) to using this resource.

Page 1, this page, introduces the new Content Models for HTML. 

Page 2 relates the [Content Root](/en/html-content-root) for the 2 sides of a web document

Page 3 provides the [33 Content Metas](/en/html-content-metas) that go into the first side of the Content Root.

Page 4 reveals the [2 Content Windows](/en/html-content-windows) that go into the second side of the Content Root.

Page 5 identifies the [14 Content Blocks](/en/html-content-blocks) that build a Content Window. 

Page 6 provides the [8 Content Parts](/en/html-content-parts) that bound the contents of a Topic Block

Page 7 conveys the [11 Content Mixes](/en/html-content-mixes) that creates compound content blocks

Page 8 introduces the [3 Content Breaks](/en/html-content-breaks) for partitions in a Block

Page 9 presents the [9 Content Objects](/en/html-content-objects) for non-textual contents in a Block

Page 10 provides the [24 Content Forms](/en/html-content-forms) to request contents in a Block

Page 11 relates the [29 Content Connotations](/en/html-content-connotations) for purpose definitions in a Block

Page 12 lists the [132 Content Attributes](/en/html-content-attributes) that modify HTML elements

Page 13 recommends a growing number of [Content Guides](/en/html-content-guides) that helps avoid future problems







This learning resource explains HTML by contents like subheading.
