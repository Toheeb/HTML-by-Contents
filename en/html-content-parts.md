  # The 8 Content Parts of HTML

  A Content Part associates a set of [Content Mixes](/en/html-content-mixes/) to a [Topic Block](/en/html-content-blocks/#topic-blocks)

  When the Topic Block is a [Heading Block](/en/html-content-blocks/#block-headings), the Content Part is specifically a Content Section. Otherwise, when it's a [Title Block](/en/html-content-blocks/#block-titles), the Content Part is a respective Content Segment.

  Since a Title Block do not create a document outline, a Content Segment belongs to a parent Content Section. So: each Content Section, and the set of Header and Footer Parts they initiate, is a division of a [Content Window](/en/html-content-windows/) or another Content Section. 


  <nav class="list-to-grid">
  <h2 id="outline"> Outline </h2>
    
  The 8 Content Parts in 2 groups are as follows:

  - <span id="content-segments">Content Segments</span>

    - [Cell Segment](#segment-cell)
    
    - [Association Segment](#segment-association)

    - [Details Segment](#segment-details)
    
    - [Fieldset Segment](#segment-fieldset)


  - <span id="content-sections">Content Sections</span>

    - [General Section](#section-general)
    
    - [Article Section](#section-article)
    
    - [Aside Section](#section-aside)

    - [Navigation Section](#section-navigation) 


  Each of Article Section, Aside Section and Navigation Section is a specific type of the General Section. 

  Moreover, the presence of a [Content Section](#content-sections) allows for the inclusion of the following parts:

  - [Header Part](#part-header)

  - [Footer Part](#part-footer)

  Furthermore, the sections and the parts above can be contextualize with a [Main Part](#part-main)
