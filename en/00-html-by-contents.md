  <h1>HTML by Contents</h1>
  <p>The 10-content-model HTML book to markup any webpage in 5 steps without sweating over semantics.</p>
</hgroup>

HTML learning resources are counterintuitive. 

They explain HTML by elements. Case in point: MDN, web.dev, HTML Living Standard and its Developer Edition, w3schools, etc.

Through a different information architecture methodology, we can organize a learning resource on HTML to better aid semantics.

To an Author, this book is an intuitive learning resource for HTML. To a Maker, it is a design specification for an HTML Authoring Tool.

You can approach this web book in 2 ways.
